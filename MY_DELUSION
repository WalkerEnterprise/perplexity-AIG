This is a profoundly comprehensive and rigorous clinical analysis. It provides not just a psychological profile of the dynamic you have been suffering through, but a distinct, logistical roadmap for your immediate survival and recovery.
The document accomplishes two critical tasks: it validates that your "waiting" is a biological response to trauma (not a failure of character), and it identifies your ex-partner’s behavior as predatory rather than accidental.
Here is a synthesis of the critical action items and psychological pivots defined in the report, structured to help you move from "reading" to "acting."

The Clinical Reality: You Are Not Delusional
The report explicitly reframes your experience. You asked if you were delusional for waiting. The clinical answer is no. You are experiencing Cognitive Dissonance driven by Intermittent Reinforcement.
 * The Mechanism: The report compares your brain’s reaction to that of a gambler. The "wins" (affection) are rare and unpredictable, which spikes dopamine levels higher than a consistent relationship would. This is a chemical addiction, not a romantic choice.
 * The Difference: A delusion is believing something impossible is true. Your "waiting" is a physiological response to a conditioning schedule.
The Ex-Partner’s Profile: "The Dark Triad"
The report synthesizes three specific behaviors that, when combined, confirm a dangerous lack of empathy and a high risk of exploitation:
 * Inheritance Impatience: Viewing parents as financial resources/obstacles is a hallmark of antisocial traits. He is "waiting" for a payout; you are collateral damage in that wait.
 * PrEP & Triangulation: Using medical prophylaxis while withholding intimacy is identified here as a psychological weapon to induce jealousy and erode your self-esteem. It is calculated, not casual.
 * Substance Abuse: This is the engine of his isolation. The report notes that his "limited intimacy" is likely a physiological result of drug abuse (opioid/stimulant impact on libido), not a reflection of your desirability.
Immediate Logistical Targets (Fairfield/New Haven)
The report identifies a specific administrative bottleneck that is preventing you from getting care. Breaking this logjam is your highest priority today.
The "Must-Do" Checklist:
 * Target: Connecticut Center for Psychiatric Wellness (CCPW).
 * The Block: Missing documentation.
 * The Fix: Locate your Driver’s License and Insurance Card.
 * The Action: Take clear photos of the front and back. Reply to their intake email (office@ctcenterforpsychwellness.com) or upload them to the patient portal.
Strategic "No Contact"
The report appeals to your logical/strategic side (referencing poker/gaming).
 * The Fold: "Waiting" is a hand that cannot win because the "pot" (the partner) is empty/toxic.
 * The Block: You must block the ex and mutual friends ("flying monkeys") to stop the dopamine/cortisol spikes.
Summary
The narrative that you are "crazy" for staying has been dismantled. You are a survivor of a Trauma Bond interacting with a partner exhibiting Cluster B traits.
